**Answer**
## Creating a Payroll Worksheet in Excel

**Here's a step-by-step guide to create the payroll worksheet in Excel:**

1. **Create a New Worksheet:**
   - Open Microsoft Excel and create a new blank worksheet.

2. **Input the Table Headers:**
   - In the first row, input the column headers as given in the table:
     * Employee Name
     * Basic Salary (B)
     * Dearness Allowance (DA) (30% of B)
     * Total Gross Salary (G)
     * Income Tax (IT) (25% of G)
     * PF (10% of G)
     * Net Salary (N)

3. **Input Employee Data:**
   - In the rows below the headers, input the names and basic salaries of the employees.

4. **Calculate Dearness Allowance (DA):**
   - In the cell next to the first employee's basic salary (B2), enter the formula: `=B2*30%`
   - This will calculate 30% of the basic salary.
   - Copy this formula down the column to calculate DA for all employees.

5. **Calculate Gross Salary (G):**
   - In the cell next to the first employee's DA, enter the formula: `=B2+C2`
   - This will add the basic salary and DA to get the gross salary.
   - Copy this formula down the column to calculate G for all employees.

6. **Calculate Income Tax (IT):**
   - In the cell next to the first employee's gross salary, enter the formula: `=D2*25%`
   - This will calculate 25% of the gross salary as income tax.
   - Copy this formula down the column to calculate IT for all employees.

7. **Calculate PF (Provident Fund):**
   - In the cell next to the first employee's income tax, enter the formula: `=D2*10%`
   - This will calculate 10% of the gross salary as PF.
   - Copy this formula down the column to calculate PF for all employees.

8. **Calculate Net Salary (N):**
   - In the last column, enter the formula: `=B2+C2-E2-F2`
   - This will calculate the net salary by subtracting IT and PF from the gross salary.
   - Copy this formula down the column to calculate N for all employees.
