 7Ã—4=28 Marks

## Question - (a) 
What are the functions of various operational units of a computer system? What is von Neumann Architecture? How can you relate von Neumann architecture to an actual computer? Explain with the help of an example configuration.

**Answer** 
Functions of Operational Units and von Neumann Architecture (Based on General Knowledge)
**Functions of Operational Units:**

A computer system is comprised of various operational units that work together to process data and instructions. Here's a breakdown of some key units:

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
- **Memory (RAM):** Holds data and instructions currently being processed by the CPU. It's volatile, meaning data is lost when power is off.
- **Input/Output (I/O) Devices:** Allow users to interact with the computer by providing input (e.g., keyboard, mouse) and displaying output (e.g., monitor, printer).
- **Control Unit (CU):** Fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and controls the execution of those instructions in the CPU.
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Performs arithmetic (addition, subtraction) and logical (AND, OR) operations on data.

**von Neumann Architecture:**

The von Neumann Architecture is a fundamental computer architecture model. It consists of the aforementioned units (CPU, memory, I/O, CU, ALU) connected by buses. These buses allow data and instructions to flow between units. 

**Relating von Neumann Architecture to an Actual Computer:**

Imagine a simple calculator. The user's input (pressing buttons) is the input. The display is the output device. The internal circuitry performs calculations (ALU) based on the user's input, following instructions stored in its memory (similar to CPU and RAM). This is a simplified analogy, but portrays the basic principles.

**Example Configuration:**

A typical desktop computer has a CPU like Intel Core i5, RAM like 16GB DDR4, storage like a 1TB hard disk drive (HDD), and various I/O devices like keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc. Each of these components plays a specific role in processing data and instructions according to the von Neumann architecture.

# Question - (d) 

(d) What is an instruction? What are its components? What is the role of an instruction in a computer? Explain with the help of an example. Where does the instruction reside at the time of execution.

**Answer**
**An instruction is a command that tells the computer to perform a specific task.** It's the basic unit of work in a computer system.

**Components of an Instruction:**

1. **Opcode (Operation Code):** This specifies the operation to be performed (e.g., add, subtract, load, store).
2. **Operand(s):** These are the data or memory addresses on which the operation is to be performed.

**Role of an Instruction:**

* **Fetching:** The instruction is fetched from memory.
* **Decoding:** The CPU decodes the instruction to understand the operation and operands.
* **Execution:** The CPU executes the instruction, performing the specified operation on the operands.
* **Storing Result:** The result of the operation is stored in memory or a register.

**Example:**

Consider the following instruction: `ADD R1, R2`

* **Opcode:** `ADD` specifies the addition operation.
* **Operands:** `R1` and `R2` are registers, which hold data.

This instruction tells the CPU to add the values stored in registers R1 and R2 and store the result in one of the registers (usually R1).

**Instruction Residence:**

At the time of execution, the instruction is fetched from the main memory (RAM) into the CPU's instruction register. Once fetched, it's decoded and executed by the CPU's control unit.



# Question - (e)
(e) A 2.5 inch diameter disk has 8 platters with each platter having two
    data recording surfaces, each platter on disk has 4084 tracks, each
    track has 400 sectors and one sector can store 1 MB of data.
    Calculate the storage capacity of this disk in Bytes. If this disk
    has a seek time of 2 milli-seconds and rotates at the speed of 6000
    rpm, find the Access time for the disk. Make suitable assumptions,
    if any.


**Answer**

## Calculating Storage Capacity and Access Time

### Storage Capacity

**Given:**
* Number of platters = 8
* Number of surfaces per platter = 2
* Number of tracks per surface = 4084
* Number of sectors per track = 400
* Bytes per sector = 1 MB = 1024 * 1024 bytes

**Calculation:**
* Total number of surfaces = 8 platters * 2 surfaces/platter = 16 surfaces
* Total number of tracks = 16 surfaces * 4084 tracks/surface = 65344 tracks
* Total number of sectors = 65344 tracks * 400 sectors/track = 26,137,600 sectors
* Total storage capacity = 26,137,600 sectors * 1,048,576 bytes/sector = **27,487,790,656 bytes** or approximately **27 TB**.

### Access Time

**Given:**
* Seek time = 2 milliseconds
* Rotation speed = 6000 RPM (revolutions per minute)

**Calculation:**
* **Rotational Latency:**
  - Time for one complete rotation = 60 seconds / 6000 rotations = 0.01 seconds
  - Average rotational latency = 0.01 seconds / 2 = 0.005 seconds or 5 milliseconds
* **Total Average Access Time:**
  - Seek time + Rotational latency = 2 milliseconds + 5 milliseconds = 7 milliseconds

**Therefore, the average access time for the disk is 7 milliseconds.**

**Note:** This is an average access time. The actual access time can vary depending on factors like the specific location of the data on the disk.

# Question - (c)

(c) Explain the differences between procedural programming and object
    oriented programming with the help of one example program of each.


**Answer**

## Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming

**Procedural Programming**

In procedural programming, the focus is on procedures or functions that perform specific tasks. Data and functions are separate entities.

**Example (C):**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void add(int a, int b) {
    int sum = a + b;
    printf("Sum: %d\n", sum);
}

int main() {
    int num1 = 10, num2 = 20;
    add(num1, num2);
    return 0;
}
```

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

In OOP, the focus is on objects, which are instances of classes. Classes define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects. 

**Example (Java):**

```java
public class Car {
    private String color;
    private int mileage;

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started.");
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car stopped.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car();
        car1.color = "Red";
        car1.mileage = 20000;
        car1.start();
        car1.stop();
    }
}
```

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Procedural Programming | Object-Oriented Programming |
|---|---|---|
| Focus | Procedures/Functions | Objects |
| Data and Functions | Separate | Encapsulated within objects |
| Modularity | Less modular | Highly modular |
| Reusability | Lower reusability | Higher reusability |
| Problem-solving approach | Top-down approach | Bottom-up approach |

**In essence:**

* **Procedural programming** is like a recipe, where you follow a sequence of steps to achieve a result.
* **Object-oriented programming** is like building a house, where you create objects (like rooms) with specific properties (size, color) and behaviors (opening, closing). 

By understanding these fundamental differences, you can choose the appropriate programming paradigm for your specific project.

# Question - (c)

(c) What is Internet? What are the major protocols used on Internet?
    What is an IP address? How can an IP address be related to a web
    address? Explain with the help of an example.
**Answer**
## The Internet: A Global Network

**What is the Internet?**

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate with each other using a standardized set of protocols. It allows users to access information and services from anywhere in the world. 

**Major Protocols:**

* **TCP/IP:** This is the fundamental protocol suite for the Internet. It provides a reliable and efficient way to transmit data across networks.
    - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** Ensures reliable data transmission by breaking data into packets, numbering them, and reassembling them in the correct order.
    - **IP (Internet Protocol):** Handles the addressing and routing of packets across the network.

* **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted.
* **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used to transfer files between computers on a network.
* **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used to send and receive email messages.
* **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3) and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol):** Used to retrieve email messages from a mail server.

**IP Address:**

An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. It's used to identify and locate devices on the network. There are two main types of IP addresses:

* **IPv4:** A 32-bit address represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
* **IPv6:** A 128-bit address, designed to accommodate the growing number of devices on the internet.

**IP Address and Web Address:**

A web address (URL) is a human-readable address that corresponds to an IP address. When you type a URL into your web browser, your computer uses a Domain Name System (DNS) to translate the URL into an IP address.

For example, when you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser, your computer queries a DNS server to find the IP address associated with `google.com`. Once it has the IP address, your computer can send a request to the server hosting the Google website.
